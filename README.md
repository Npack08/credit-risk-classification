# credit-risk-classification
Overview of the Analysis
In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to compare the credit risks associated with borrowers. Labels such as '(0)' healthy loan and '(1)' high risk loan leabels are used in the model to visualize and present the data findings.

Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial data was stored in a csv file. Using panadas, I created a path to view the csv file data in a pandas dataframe. After creating the dataframe I then split the daya into training and testing sets.

Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., LogisticRegression, or any resampling method).
Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Machine Learning Model 1:

Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Machine Learning Model 2:

Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the 1's, or predict the 0's? )
If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
